# Compute the discharge conditions for exhaust gases for small and medium combustion systems and other installations (Berechnung der Ableitbedingungen f√ºr Abgase von kleinen und mittleren Feuerungsanlagen sowie andere als Feuerungsanlagen)

We aim at making standards accessible to everyone. However, this effort is only possible if you are involved in such projects in some way. Do not hesitate to contact us <info@richtershuels.de>.

## Introduction
This library computes the discharge conditions for exhaust gases according to VDI 3781 Part 4 (07/2017). It is well-suited to compute the outlet height taking into account section 6 of VDI 3781 Part 4. The library is separted into three parts:

- outletheight: Computation of the outlet height according to Flowchart defined in Section 6.1. 
- undisturbedremoval: Considering the fluid mechanical requirements for the undisturbed removal of exhaust gases, which is defined in Section 6.2.
- adequatedilution: Taking into account surrounding buildings, hillside location etc. to examine the requirements for adequate dilution as defined in Section 6.3.

The idea of this library is to implement the core definitions of the standard. It is up to the users of this library to add extra functionality like visualizations, creation of reports etc.

## Usage

This software is a python module with the main data types **Roof** and **Model**. The **Roof** data type defines the type of the roof and all parameters corresponding to a roof. These parameters are independent of the exact position of the outlet or whether the roof is belonging to the outlet or not. For every computation of an exact outlet height, a **Model** is needed. The model also describes the parameters which are dependent on the exact outlet position.
